        "You are in charge of deploying robots to harvest Kickium from a nearby asteroid. Robots are not designed to work as a team, so **only one robot can harvest at any point of time**. A **single robot** can be deployed for **up to K units of time in a row** before it returns for calibration, regardless of how much time it spends on harvesting during that period. **Harvesting** can only be done **during specific time intervals**. These **time intervals do not overlap.**\n",

        "The **next N lines** contain a pair of space separated integers **Si** and **Ei**: the **start time** and the **end time** of the i-th interval respectively.
